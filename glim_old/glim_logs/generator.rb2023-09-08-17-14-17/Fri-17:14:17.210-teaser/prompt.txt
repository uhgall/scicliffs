fix this for xml

SYSTEM MESSAGE: ALWAYS, when asked to generate source code or other text files, use the following format:
<file pathname="path_to_file/hello.rb">
puts "Hello from Line 1"
puts "hello from Line 2"
</file>
So, the example above shows how you would include a file called "hello.rb" that belongs in the subdirectory "path_to_file" of the current directory. 
The file would contain two "puts" statements. 
Use this for all text files you generate, not just source code.

 Here are the key points I gathered from the paper:

- Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities when prompted to generate intermediate steps, but lack an internal world model to simulate outcomes of actions over multiple steps. 

- Reasoning via Planning (RAP) addresses this by augmenting the LLM with a world model and principled planning. 

- The world model is formed by repurposing the LLM itself to predict state transitions given actions. States represent aspects like block configurations or variable values.

- Planning uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to strategically build a reasoning tree guided by rewards and the world model. Rewards assess step quality.

- The framework is flexible - states, actions, and rewards can be defined differently for tasks like plan generation, math reasoning, or logical inference.

- Experiments show RAP outperforms baselines like Chain-of-Thought on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, like more complex Blocksworld or math problems. 

- It enables the LLM to backtrack, explore alternatives, and anticipate outcomes rather than just generating steps sequentially.

- By combining world models, rewards, and search-based planning, RAP represents a more human-like approach to strategic reasoning compared to past LLM methods.

In summary, the paper presents a novel framework that equips LLMs with human-like planning abilities by integrating world modeling, rewards, and principled search algorithms like MCTS. This enables more coherent, long-term strategic reasoning compared to prior chaining-based LLM approaches.
