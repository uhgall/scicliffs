The researchers call their approach \"Reasoning via Planning\", or RAP for short. Let me break down what they're doing and how it compares to previous techniques.\n\nAs we all know, large language models like GPT-3 have shown some remarkable reasoning abilities when prompted in the right way. A popular method is called \"Chain-of-Thought\", where the model generates a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at an answer. However, the researchers point out some key limitations of this approach - language models currently lack an internal representation of the problem \"world\" and how it might change as reasoning progresses. \n\nThis is where humans have a big advantage - we form mental models of situations to simulate potential outcomes of our actions. The researchers argue this ability to mentally \"plan ahead\" is central to how humans tackle complex, multi-step reasoning. So their insight was - what if we give language models a similar planning capability?\n\nThat's the core idea behind RAP. The key innovations are:\n\n1) Building a \"world model\" by repurposing the language model itself. It acts as a simulator that can predict how the problem state changes in response to proposed reasoning steps.\n\n2) Formulating the reasoning process as a \"planning problem\" where the goal is to optimize rewards. Rewards assess the quality and usefulness of each reasoning step.\n\n3) Applying a powerful planning algorithm called Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore different reasoning paths and focus on high-reward ones. \n\nThis allows the language model to deliberately consider the long-term impact of its actions, just like how humans plan strategies. It can anticipate outcomes, backtrack bad ideas, and iteratively refine its reasoning.\n\nThe researchers tested RAP on diverse challenges like mathematics, logic puzzles, and developing action plans. It significantly outperformed previous methods and even surpassed more powerful language models in some tasks!\n\nI find this work really intriguing. By giving language models strategic planning skills on par with humans, we may finally bridge the gap in their complex reasoning abilities. It will be exciting to see where RAP could lead if further developed. Overall, a clever approach showing the potential for more human-like artificial intelligence.",
