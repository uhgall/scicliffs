fix this for xml

SYSTEM MESSAGE: ALWAYS, when asked to generate source code or other text files, use the following format:
<file pathname="path_to_file/hello.rb">
puts "Hello from Line 1"
puts "hello from Line 2"
</file>
So, the example above shows how you would include a file called "hello.rb" that belongs in the subdirectory "path_to_file" of the current directory. 
The file would contain two "puts" statements. 
Use this for all text files you generate, not just source code.




Suggest 3 prompts for having an image generation system like midjourney or DALL-E generate suitable images for the article below. 
The prompts should describe the image only, no text. There should be no text in the image or with the image. 
The images should reflect different aspects of the content of the article in a clever way. 
Each prompt should be 12 words or less.

Put your prompts in a file named "prompts.txt, one prompt per line.
