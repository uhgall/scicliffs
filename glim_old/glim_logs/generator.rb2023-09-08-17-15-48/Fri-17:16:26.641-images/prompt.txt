SYSTEM MESSAGE: ALWAYS, when asked to generate source code or other text files, use the following format:
<file pathname="path_to_file/hello.rb">
puts "Hello from Line 1"
puts "hello from Line 2"
</file>
So, the example above shows how you would include a file called "hello.rb" that belongs in the subdirectory "path_to_file" of the current directory. 
The file would contain two "puts" statements. 
Use this for all text files you generate, not just source code.

 Here is an article in Markdown format summarizing the key points of the academic paper "Reasoning with Language Model is Planning with World Model":

# New Approach Enables Language Models to Reason Like Humans

Researchers at UC San Diego and the University of Florida have developed a new technique that allows large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to reason more like humans. 

## The Limitations of Current LLMs

LLMs like GPT-3 have shown impressive reasoning abilities, especially when prompted to generate intermediate reasoning steps (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting). However, they still struggle with complex tasks that require multiple steps of reasoning, such as:

- Generating action plans to execute tasks in a given environment 
- Performing complex mathematical or logical reasoning

The key deficiency is that LLMs lack an **internal world model** to simulate outcomes of actions. This prevents deliberative planning where the model considers future states and iteratively refines reasoning steps.

## Introducing Reasoning via Planning (RAP)

To address these limitations, the researchers propose **Reasoning via Planning (RAP)**. RAP incorporates two key components into the LLM:

- **World Model:** The LLM is repurposed to simulate states of the world after actions.
- **Planning Algorithm:** Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to explore reasoning trajectories and find high reward paths. 

This enables the LLM to look ahead at potential outcomes, and strategically build reasoning chains with a balance of exploration vs exploitation.

## Evaluating RAP on Diverse Reasoning Tasks

The researchers evaluated RAP on challenging reasoning tasks:

- **Plan generation** in Blocksworld: RAP achieved 64% success rate compared to near 0% for baseline CoT.
- **Math reasoning** on GSM8k dataset: RAP improves accuracy from 29.4% (CoT) to 51.6%.
- **Logical reasoning** on PrOntoQA: RAP gets 94.2% accuracy compared to 87.8% for CoT.

RAP consistently outperformed strong baselines like chain-of-thought and self-consistency prompting. The improvements demonstrate RAP's ability to reason more strategically.

## Conclusion

By incorporating planning with a world model, RAP represents an important step towards human-like reasoning for LLMs. The flexibility of RAP makes it a general framework that could enable more capable reasoning across diverse applications.

Overall, RAP offers an exciting new direction to realize stronger artificial intelligence through integrating planning and reasoning.
