fix this for xml

SYSTEM MESSAGE: ALWAYS, when asked to generate source code or other text files, use the following format:
<file pathname="path_to_file/hello.rb">
puts "Hello from Line 1"
puts "hello from Line 2"
</file>
So, the example above shows how you would include a file called "hello.rb" that belongs in the subdirectory "path_to_file" of the current directory. 
The file would contain two "puts" statements. 
Use this for all text files you generate, not just source code.

 Here are the key points about the RAP framework for reasoning with language models proposed in the paper:

- RAP augments the LLM with a world model and uses planning algorithms to search for optimal reasoning traces, rather than generating them autoregressively. This makes the reasoning process more similar to human strategic planning.

- The world model is built by repurposing the LLM itself with prompts. It represents the state of the reasoning problem and predicts how states will change with actions. 

- Reasoning is formulated as a Markov decision process, where states represent intermediate reasoning contexts and actions represent incremental reasoning steps.

- Monte Carlo tree search is used as the planning algorithm to efficiently explore the reasoning space and balance exploration vs exploitation.

- Rewards are defined to assess the quality of reasoning steps based on likelihood, confidence, self-evaluation, etc. Rewards guide the search.

- RAP is applied to different problem types like plan generation, math reasoning, logical inference by defining states/actions accordingly. 

- Experiments show RAP outperforms baseline methods like CoT, self-consistency, least-to-most prompting on various benchmarks.

- RAP provides a flexible framework for reasoning tasks by allowing customization of states, actions, and rewards based on problem structure.

In summary, RAP enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating principled planning via a world model representation. This bridges the gap between LLM and human strategic reasoning capabilities.
