In 1994, a mathematical physicist from the\nUniversity of New York, unknown outside a closed circle of physicists, sent an article to\nthe journal Social Text, entitled Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative\nHermeneutics of Quantum Gravity [1].\n\n    The text was peppered with accurate quotations by physicists such as Bohr and Heisen-\nberg and philosophers, sociologists, historians of science or psychoanalysts such as Kuhn,\nFeyerabend, Latour, Lacan, Deleuze, Guattari, Derrida, Lyotard, Serres or Virilio. In the\n\nbibliography the text also listed authors such as Lupasco: the included middle being given\nas an example of ”feminist logic”. Sokal’s commentary made however a number of ab-\nsurd assertions, creating the impression that he was perfectly attuned to postmodernism\nand, in particular, to the Cultural Studies current of thinking. The journal’s editors were\ndelighted with the apparent adhesion of a physicist to their cause and published Sokal’s\n\ntext without hesitation, without even the slightest veriﬁcation.\n\n    Almost as soon as the article appeared in print Sokal himself revealed the hoax in a\nfurther article published in Lingua Franca [2] and, from that moment on, buoyed by the\neﬀect the Internet, his fame was made. On a political level, Sokal wanted to show his\nfriends of the American left wing that a revolution or social transformation could not be\ncarried out based of the notion of reality as presented by philosophical relativism. Only\n\nphysics (in fact, according to Sokal’s view on what physics is) could play such a role.\n\n    This unleashed a storm of reactions on the Internet and the publication of books and\ncountless journal articles on the exposure of a very real problem. For some Sokal was the\napostle of Enlightenment against the post-modern obscurantists. For others he was part\nof the thought police or merely a philistine imposture.\n\n    The Sokal Aﬀair had the merit of highlighting a phenomenon that is becoming increas-\ningly pervasive in contemporary culture: that of the radicalisation of relativism. Indeed,\nit is evident that relativist extremism has a nefarious capacity to appropriate the language\n\nof the exact sciences. Taken out of context, this language can then be manipulated to\nsay almost anything, indeed to demonstrate that everything is relative. The ﬁrst victims\nof this form of deconstruction are the exact sciences that ﬁnd themselves relegated to the\nrank of mere social constructs among many others, once the constraint of experimental\nveriﬁcation is put into parentheses. It is, therefore, not surprising that in a few months\n\nAlan Sokal became the hero of a community that is aware of a blatant contradiction\nbetween its every day practices and its social and cultural representation.\n\n    Paradoxically, however, the Sokal Aﬀair served to reveal the extent of another form\nof extremism namely scientist extremism, the mirror-image of religious extremism. In-\ndeed, Sokal’s position was supported by some notable heavyweights including the Nobel\nPrizewinner Steven Weinberg, who wrote a long article in the New York Review of Books\n\n[3].\n\n    For Weinberg ”The gulf of misunderstanding between scientists and other intellectuals\nseems to be at least as wide as when C. P. Snow worried about it three decades ago”.\nBut what is the cause of this “gulf of misunderstanding”? According to Weinberg, one of\n\n\n                                             2the essential conditions for the birth of modern science what the severance of the world of\nphysics from the world of culture. Consequently, from that moment on, any interaction\nbetween science and culture can only be seen as detrimental. And with this, in one fell\nswoop, he dismissed as irrelevant the philosophical considerations of the founding fathers\nof quantum mechanics.\n\n    To some, Weinberg’s arguments caused some to smart as if from the whiﬀ of the\nscientism of another century: the appeal to common sense in support the claim about the\n\nreality of physical laws, the discovery through physics of the world as it is, the one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the laws of physics and objective reality, the hegemony on an\nintellectual level of the natural science (because we have a clear idea of what it means\nfor a theory to be true or false). However, Weinberg is certainly neither a positivist nor\na mechanist. He is without doubt one of the most distinguished physicists of the 20th\n\ncentury and a man of broad culture, and due attention should be paid to his arguments.\n\n    Weinberg’s central idea, repeatedly pounded out like a mantra, concerns the discovery\nby physics of the existence of impersonal laws, the impersonal and eternal laws which\nguarantee the objective progress of science and which explain the unfathomable gulf be-\ntween science and culture. The tone of the argument is overtly prophetic, as if in the name\nof a strange religion without God. One is almost tempted to believe in the immaculate\n\nconception of science. We are led to understand, therefore, that for Weinberg, what is\nreally at stake in the Sokal Aﬀair is the status of truth and reality. Truth, by deﬁnition,\ncannot depend on the social environment of the scientist. Science is the custodian of\ntruth and, as such, its severance with culture is complete and deﬁnitive. There is only\none Reality: the objective reality of physics. Weinberg states unequivocally that for cul-\n\nture or philosophy, the diﬀerence between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics or\nbetween Newton and Einsteins theory of gravitation is insigniﬁcant. The contempt with\nwhich Weinberg treats the notion of hermeneutics therefore seems quite natural.\n\n    Weinberg’s conclusion comes down like a cleaver: ”the conclusions of physics may\nbecome relevant to philosophy and culture when we learn the origin of the universe or the\nﬁnal laws of nature”, that is to say never!\n\n    In 1997, Sokal decided to write a counterargument to the famous Social Text article,\nto express his actual thinking. For this he took on as a co-author, the Belgian physicist\n\nJean Bricmont, who was supposed to have a good knowledge of the intellectual situation\nin France. The collaboration resulted in the publication of Intellectual Impostures, which\nvia its provoking title was intended to become a bestseller. I do not know if its hoped-for\ndestiny was ever attained, but the content of the book surprised by its intellectual patch-\niness and the repercussions were far beneath the resounding success of Sokal’s original\n\nhoax. The impostors in question - most of whom are French - are Jacques Lacan, Julia\nKristeva, Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari\nand Paul Virilio.\n\n    It would be tedious to go over again, here, the nature of the “imposture”. The method\nof the American and Belgian physicists was simple: sentences are removed from their\noriginal context and then shown to be meaningless or inaccurate from the perspective\n\n\n                                             3of mathematics or physics. For example, Lacan wrote that: “In this pleasure space\n(espace de jouissance), to take something that is bounded, closed, constitutes a locus,\nto speak of it is a topology” [4]. Sokal and Bricmonts commentary follows: “In this\nsentence, Lacan uses four mathematical technical terms (‘space’, ‘bounded’, ‘closed’ and\n‘topology’) but without paying attention to their meaning; this sentence is meaningless\n\nfrom a mathematical point of view.” [5] The method used by the authors disqualiﬁes the\nbook and people thought that the Sokal Aﬀair was deﬁnitively closed.\n\n    But Sokal is back. He has just published in France a new book with the catchy title\nPseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers? [6]. It is to be\nnoted in passing that Jean Bricmont has written or largely contributed to a third of the\nbook. Indeed, in the introduction, he sets the scene by quoting, in the ﬁrst lines, Jerry\nFodor: “The point of view to which I adhere [...] is scientism.”\n\n    It is undoubtedly the case that drawing comparisons between postmodernism and\n\npseudoscience has a certain appeal, even if Sokal concedes that he has only found a few\npostmodern thinkers who rally to the cause of the pseudosciences.\n\n    The real novelty of the book is elsewhere, however, and can be found in Appendix\nA entitled ‘Religion as pseudoscience”. It should be made clear, here, that Sokal is not\nreferring to cults or new religious movements, but to established religions : Christianity,\nJudaism, Islam and Hindouism. It is, therefore, hardly surprising that Sokal points an\n\naccusatory ﬁnger at Pope John Paul II, described by Sokal as the head of a “major\npseudoscientiﬁc cult, Catholicism” [7].\n\n    This last aﬃrmation smacks simply of defamation though it is interesting, nonetheless,\nto try to understand why religion for Sokal (and Bricmont) is a pseudoscience in the same\nway that astrology is.\n\n    Sokal candidly explains that “religion refers to real or alleged phenomena, or real or\nalleged causal relations, which modern science views as improbable”. He goes on “that\n[religion] attempts to base its aﬃrmations on a form of reasoning and system of proofs\n\nthat is far from satisfying the criteria of modern science in terms of logic and veriﬁcation”\n[8]. Sokal’s epistemological error is plain to see: he assumes modern science to be the\nonly arbiter of truth and Reality. At no point does he entertain the idea of a plurality of\nlevels of Reality, with science applying to certain levels and religion to others. For Sokal\nthere can only be one level of Reality, a hypothesis which is epistemologically untenable\n\nin light of what modern science has taught us.\n    Sokal’s attitude is strangely reminiscent of Lenins position when, in 1908, in Ma-\n\nterialism and Empiriocriticism, he attacked the theories of physics implied the multi-\ndimensional space-time, by proclaiming that the revolution could only be carried out in\nfour dimensions. Lenin, like Sokal, believed in the existence of a single level of Reality.\nOr rather, he stuck to this belief, to justify his revolution.\n\n    It seems clear that we could ﬁnd numerous arguments to pick serious holes in the\naﬃrmations made by Sokal and his friends. But, to my mind, this approach is futile,\n\nand going down this alley merely runs with the risk entering an interminable polemic\n\n                                             4involving the parodying of the other sides position to the point of trading insults. The\n\nthree extremisms at stake here, of which religious extremism is the one which the public is\nmost familiar, have brought to the fore a fundamental problem that of the status of truth\nand Reality and of showing us the consequences, including the political consequences of\nthis problem.\n\n    What we need to do at present it to go beyond these three extremisms, which are\nthe germ of new forms of totalitarianism. The Sokal aﬀair gives us a good opportunity\nto reformulate, on a new and rigorous basis, not only the conditions for the dialogue\n\nbetween the hard sciences and the humanities, but also of the dialogue between science\nand culture, science and society and science and spirituality. Ultimately, the source of the\nviolent polemic unleashed by the Sokal Aﬀair is the considerable confusion between the\ntools and the conditions of the dialogue. Sokal and his friends are right to denounce the\nanarchic migration of concepts from the hard sciences to the humanities which can only\n\nlead to a semblance of rigor and validity. But the moderate relativists are also right to\ndenounce the desire expressed by certain scientists to ban the dialogue between science\nand culture. Indeed, Weinberg falls prey to exactly the same form of confusion as his\ncontradictors. Why does he declare himself to be “against philosophy” (title of one of\nthe chapters of his book Dreams of a Final Theory [9])? Simply because he criticises the\ntools of philosophy as not being productive in the process of scientiﬁc creation.\n\n    Are we obliged to choose between these three extremisms, as the only possible out-\n\ncome? Certainly not. Transdisciplinarity is a rampart against the fascination caused by\nthe three extremisms.\n\n    If there is a dialogue between the diﬀerent disciplines, it cannot be founded on the\nconcepts of one or other discipline but what the disciplines have in common: the Subject\nitself. The Subject which, in the interaction with the Object, refuses any form of for-\nmalisation and which always maintains an element of irreducible mystery. The Subject\nwhich throughout the 20th century has been considered as the Object: object of experi-\n\nence, object of ideologies which claimed to be scientiﬁc, object of scientiﬁc studies that\nare aimed at dissecting it, formalising and manipulating it, and revealing in so doing, a\nself-destructing process in the irrational struggle of the human being against himself. At\nthe end of the day, it is to the resurrection of the Subject that the Sokal Aﬀair sends us\na veritable transdisciplinary quest, the painstaking working out of a new art of living and\nthinking.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n [1] Alan D.
