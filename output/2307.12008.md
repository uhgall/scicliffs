Introduction:

Since the discovery of the first superconductor, scientists have been searching for new room-temperature superconductors. Recently, there have been breakthroughs in developing room-temperature superconductors with hydrogen sulfide and yttrium super-hydride. However, these materials require extremely high pressures, making practical applications challenging. 

In this groundbreaking study, the researchers at Quantum Energy Research Centre, Inc. and Korea University report the synthesis of the first room-temperature and ambient-pressure superconductor named LK-99. They prove the superconductivity of LK-99 using various techniques, including critical temperature, zero-resistivity, critical current, critical magnetic field, and the Meissner effect. 

Unique Structure and Stress-Induced Superconductivity:

The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from a minute structural distortion caused by Cu substitution of Pb ions in the insulating network of Pb-phosphate. This substitution leads to a slight volume shrinkage of 0.48%, generating stress in the material. The stress transfers to the cylindrical column interface, resulting in distortion and the creation of superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. 

Heat capacity measurements confirm that the new model is suitable for explaining the superconductivity of LK-99. The researchers highlight that the unique structure of LK-99, which allows the maintenance of the distorted structure in the interfaces, is the key factor for its superconductivity at room temperatures and ambient pressure.

Potential Applications:

The discovery of LK-99 opens up possibilities for various applications, such as magnets, motors, cables, levitation trains, power cables, qubits for quantum computers, and THz antennas. The researchers believe that LK-99 will serve as an important material for future research on superconductivity and will contribute to solving the puzzles surrounding superconductivity, including the pairing process and coexistence with magnetism.

Conclusion:

The successful synthesis of LK-99, the first room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductor, represents a major milestone in the field of superconductivity. The researchers have demonstrated the unique structural characteristics and stress-induced superconductivity in LK-99. This discovery paves the way for further research and applications of superconductors at room temperature.
