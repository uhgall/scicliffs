#  Scientists Synthesize Game-Changing "Zero-Pressure" Superconductor 

  Scientists discover a superconductor that maintains its properties at room temperature without high pressure - but how?

 # The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor 

## 1 Introduction

 Since the discovery of the first superconductor(1), many efforts to search for new room-
temperature superconductors have been carried out worldwide(2, 3) through their experimental
clarity or/and theoretical perspectives(4-8). The recent success of developing room-temperature
superconductors with hydrogen sulfide(9) and yttrium super-hydride(10) has great attention
worldwide, which is expected by strong electron-phonon coupling theory with high-frequency
hydrogen phonon modes(11, 12). However, it is difficult to apply them to actual application
devices in daily life because of the tremendously high pressure, and more efforts are being made
to overcome the high-pressure problem(13).

 For the first time in the world, we report the success in synthesizing a room-temperature and
ambient-pressure superconductor with a chemical approach to solve the temperature and pressure
problem. We named the first room temperature and ambient pressure superconductor LK-99. The
superconductivity of LK-99 proved with the Critical temperature (Tc), Zero-resistivity, Critical
current (Jc), Critical magnetic field (Hc), and Meissner effect(14, 15). Several data were collected
and analyzed in detail to figure out the puzzle of superconductivity of LK-99: X-ray diffraction
(XRD), X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS), Electron ParamagneticResonance Spectroscopy
(EPR), Heat Capacity, and Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) data.


Henceforth in this paper, we will report and discuss our new findings including superconducting
quantum wells associated with the superconductivity of LK-99.
