 # Researchers Use Planning with World Model to Enhance Language Model Reasoning 

Researchers at UC San Diego, University of Florida, and Zhongshan (Sun Yat-sen) University recently published a paper introducing a new method to improve reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. The key innovation is enabling the LLM to simulate a **world model** to look ahead and anticipate the effects of potential reasoning steps.

LLMs have shown impressive reasoning skills when prompted to generate chains of reasoning (known as **Chain-of-Thought** or CoT prompting). However, they still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning tasks like generating action plans or solving math word problems. 

The authors identify several limitations of CoT reasoning:

- LLMs lack an internal world model to predict how states evolve based on actions. Humans leverage world models to simulate potential future scenarios when planning and reasoning.

- LLMs have no mechanism to assess the quality of reasoning steps and guide the chain towards a desired solution.

- LLMs cannot balance exploration vs. exploitation to efficiently search the vast space of reasoning possibilities.

To address these issues, the researchers propose **Reasoning via Planning (RAP)**. RAP incorporates two key components into the LLM:

**World Model**: The LLM is repurposed to simulate a world model by predicting state transitions based on actions. For example, in a block manipulation task, the world model predicts how the configuration of blocks changes after taking an action like "pickup red block".

**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: The well-known MCTS algorithm is used to guide the LLM to incrementally construct a reasoning tree. The LLM evaluates future rewards to focus on high-quality chains.

RAP was tested on several reasoning tasks:

- In **Blocksworld**, RAP achieved a 64% success rate on 2/4/6 step plan generation problems, compared to near 0% for CoT.

- In **math reasoning** on the GSM8K dataset, RAP improved accuracy to 51.6% from 29.4% for CoT.

- For **logical reasoning** on the PrOntoQA benchmark, RAP increased proof accuracy to 78.8% from 64.8% for CoT.

The results demonstrate RAP's ability to enhance LLM reasoning across diverse tasks. The researchers posit that equipping LLMs with more human-like planning capabilities could pave the way towards more advanced reasoning in AI systems.

Errata:

  Here are some potential typos, inaccuracies, dubious claims, and other issues I noticed in the paper:

- The author list contains a typo - the email address for author "Shibo Hao" is incorrect (s5hao instead of shao@ucsd.edu based on other papers from this author). 

- In the abstract, the phrase "planning with World Model" should be "planning with a World Model".

- The definition of "world model" in the introduction is overly simplistic. A world model does more than just predict the next state, it attempts to model the environment dynamics.

- In Section 3.1, the description of using the LLM as both the world model and the agent is unclear. Typically these would be separate models. Reusing the same LLM for both may introduce biases. 

- The statement "RAP is a more general approach applicable to a wide range of reasoning problems" requires more justification. RAP has only been evaluated on a few task types so far.

- In Section 3.2, the description of the "confidence of state" reward is ambiguous. More details are needed on how it is calculated.

- In Section 4.1, the authors claim RAP allows LLaMA-33B to outperform GPT-4. However, the compared models have very different sizes, so the comparison may not be fair.

- In Section 4.2, details are missing on how the baselines like Chain-of-Thought are configured for the math reasoning task. 

- The accuracy results on GSM8K dataset are quite low for all methods. This suggests the problem may be more difficult than presented.

- There are multiple grammatical, punctuation and formatting issues throughout the paper that need to be addressed.

In summary, while the RAP framework seems promising, the paper makes very strong claims that need more careful qualification, and more analysis is needed to evaluate the approach against baselines across different tasks. Addressing the above issues would improve the clarity and robustness of the results.
