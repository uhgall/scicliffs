Suggest 3 prompts for having an image generation system like midjourney or DALL-E generate suitable images for the article below. 
The prompts should describe the image only, no text. There should be no text in the image or with the image. 
The images should reflect different aspects of the content of the article in a clever way. 
Each prompt should be 12 words or less.

Put the prompts into into an XML file tag, like this, with one prompt per line.
<file pathname="prompts.txt">
prompt1
prompt2
prompt3
</file>
